//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
324 + 9856 + 70

3060 - 2773

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
506 * 490
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
2675 / 16
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(3000 + 5800 + 6788) / 3
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
